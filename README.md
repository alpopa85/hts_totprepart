# TotPrePart
Total Precipitation Partitioning Tool (TotPrePart) is an online tool for estimation of daily snowfall and rainfall amounts based on 
user-provided daily air temperature and total precipitation. TotPrePart estimates snowfall and rainfall as mm of water 
and further allows for conversion of the snowfall amount into centimeters of snow. TotPrePart includes calibration routines 
and bivariate statistics for optimization of model output.
